.SYNOPSIS
Build RedGate.SIPFrameworkShared.

.DESCRIPTION
This is really a wrapper around build.ps1 (build.ps1 is our actual build script. E.g.(the script that tells you how to build this crazy thing)
2 main steps:
    1 - Restore nuget packages that are needed to get our build engine/tools.
    2 - Execute the build. (Invoke-Build build.ps1)

In theory, Teamcity will also use this build command. Probably like this: 'build -Task Build'

.EXAMPLE
build -Task Compile, UnitTests
Run the build script and only execute the 'Compile' and 'UnitTests' tasks.

.EXAMPLE
build
The simplest example! Just execute the build with default values for the -Task parameter.
