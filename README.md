SIPFrameworkShared
==================
These are the shared interfaces for addins written for Red Gate's SSMS ecosystem project. 

You should use this code for reference only, when building an addin you will need to use a [DLL signed by Red Gate](http://www.nuget.org/packages/RedGate.SIPFrameworkShared).
